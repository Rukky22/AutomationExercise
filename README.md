To run the automation project, simple go to the src/test/java folder inside the AutomationExercise project. In the folder, locate the org.Selenium.pom.test package and inside the package, there is a sanityTestCases.java class. 
The sanityTestCases.java file is configured to run a testng annotation call test. Click on the run button just below the @Test annotation to run the project.
